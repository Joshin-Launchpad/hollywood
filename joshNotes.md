4. ChatWindow 'ul' tag removal. When I removed the 'ul' tag in 'ChatWindow.js':
  - issue: In Firefox the 'ul' bullet points did not display, however in Chrome and Safari the 'ul' bullet points were visible.
  - solution: I styled the 'li' (list) tag so that the bullet point was no longer visable instead of removing the 'ul' tag. I imported the 'index.css' file into the 'ChatWindow.js' file to accomplish this.
